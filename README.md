# Water_quality_prediction_AICTE-internship


This project uses machine learning to predict water pollutant levels based on historical water quality data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction for future years.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, date parsing, feature engineering)

Exploratory data analysis with visualizations (bar and scatter plots)

Multi-output regression using Random Forest

Model evaluation using RÂ² and MSE metrics

Predicts pollutant values for a given station and year (e.g., 2024)

Model saving for future use

Requirements

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
joblib
